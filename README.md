A quick tool I made for calculating the best grinding strategy in Knights & Dragons. It does so by simulating every possible battle strategy 200 times each.

If you want to use this yourself, edit the `data.js` file. A fair amount of documentation can also be found there. The zone list is also incomplete (and not totally accurate). If you want to work on that, you'll need to throw the right numbers into the 'attack stat' calculator I have at the bottom of the `battle-sim.js` file.
